# Carnegie Mellon University

# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 3

## Topics

In week 3 we study client side web technologies such as Javascript, XML, and JSON.
We begin our study of WebSockets. We demonstrate how WebSockets may be used to carry messages
between a browser and an MQTT broker. Real time interactions are displayed in a browser using the Google Charts Javascript library.

+ Client side AJAX in Javascript
+ Client and server side Websockets
+ The MQTT protocol
+ Demonstration: Real time mouse movements through an MQTT broker
+ Demonstration: A Java application communicates through an MQTT broker to Google Charts in a browser
+ Demonstration: A Micro controller communicates through an MQTT broker to a browser
