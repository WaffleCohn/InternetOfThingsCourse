# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 2

## Topics

In week 2 we consider how the World Wide Web provides guidance on the construction of the internet of things. In particular, we look at important details associated with server side AJAX.

Security and privacy are continuing concerns. We argue that, with the adoption of web standards, an interoperable internet of things is possible.

The Particle IDE is introduced and over the air updates are described and shown. Micro controller to servlet interactions are demonstrated.  

+ Enabling the Internet of Things
+ Four HTTP interaction patterns
+ Server side AJAX in Java
+ Demonstration: Websocket whiteboard
+ Demonstration: Sharing the shopping cart
+ Demonstration: Microcontroller to Servlet communication
