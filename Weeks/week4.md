# Carnegie Mellon University

# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 4

## Topics

Two use cases are introduced, Sensor Andrew and OpenChirp. Both of these
are IoT initiatives built at Carnegie Mellon. We go into detail on the MQTT protocol, client side technologies such as micro controllers, personal area networks, programmable logic controllers, and SCADA systems.

+ MQTT Qualities of Service
+ OpenChirp architecture from CMU
+ IIoT and SCADA
+ Microcontrollers and Wireless PAN Protocols
+ LoRa and LoRaWan video  
+ Web of Things Video
+ Introduction to XMPP
+ Demonstration: Webhooks
