# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 4

## Topics

In week 4 we go into detail on the MQTT protocol. We also discuss client side technologies
such as Micro controllers, personal area networks, OpenChirp from CMU, programmable logic controllers (PLC's), and SCADA systems. We conclude with an interesting use case - Sensor Andrew at CMU.

+ MQTT Qualities of Service  
+ Demonstration: MQTT
