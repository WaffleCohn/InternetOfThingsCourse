## Student Selected Project

### Project 4 Specifications

+ The purpose of Project 4 is to allow students to either a) work with an IoT
related technology that is of interest but not directly covered in the course or
b) prepare an IoT related presentation on an article published in a peer reviewed
journal. If the student selects the first option, a brief demonstration is required
with the presentation.

+ Groups are permitted. Each group will have between 1 and 4 members.

+ The presentations will be scheduled during the last week of
class but prior to final exam week. If time runs short, a group may be asked to
give the presentation and demonstration to the instructor outside of class.

+ It should be noted that Project 4 is not subject to the same late
assignment policy as Projects 1 through 3. Project 4 must be completed during the
time slot allocated by the instructor. One of the main reasons for this project is to
educate others on the selected topic/technology. Only in rare cases, e.g., a medical
emergency, will a student be able to give a presentation outside of class.

+ Presentations will be evaluated using the following criteria:

       1) Was the presentation and/or demonstration related to IoT or WoT ?
       2) Did the student contribute to the demonstration?
       3) Was the presentation and/or demonstration compelling and clear?
       4) Was the presentation on a topic appropriate for the audience?

+ Groups of more than one are permitted but it is required that each team
member presents for five minutes.
